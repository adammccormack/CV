I am hugely passionate about developing professional, clean, tested, reusable code, and working on developing and improving products.

My highest priority is to work in a supportive environment that embraces coding best practices that will strengthen and extend my knowledge, helping me reach my goal of becoming an expert in my field.
 
I have over ten years of experience in non-tech front and back-office roles and recently in software development and web design, providing me with valuable soft and hard transferable skills.

I am continually excited by programming and its seemingly endless creative possibilities and aim to expand my full stack and backend development knowledge.

## Skills

### Analytical ###

- Part of what drew me to programming was its analytical nature, it resonates with me as I have always innately been curious about how things work and sought to understand them at a deeper level. I think this is another reason why I love art and learned the fundamentals of illustration, colour theory and design because as an artist you have to learn how to analyse, breakdown and truly understand what you're looking at in order to understand the rules of the physical world around us (i.e. light and material), then once you learn these rules you can manipulate them and use them to create believable things from your imagination.

### Creative ###

- As a self-taught artist, I have freelanced as a digital painter and also recently completed web design work for a client. When creating, one of my favourite stages is planning as it requires the most exploration and consideration of many different ideas/designs where I will try to tackle the problem from many different angles to ensure there are a wide variety of choices when deciding the final design. 

### Adaptable ###

- Through my ten years of previous work experience I had to adapt to working in a variety of industries, teams and with many different types of people, as a result I enjoy meeting and working with new people and can appreciate the importance of team dynamics. 
In my experience at Makers Academy and in my freelance web development role, project specifications sometimes changed at quite late notice where you had to adapt and change your momentum and course swiftly in order to meet the new demands and targets. 

### Persistent ###

- During my time at Makers Academy, as part of a large group project I strived to implement an action cable messenger app on our Instagram inspired project, I worked many late nights until the stretch goal was met as I was determined to get the app working, no other team had this feature which was a proud moment for me.

### Team-player ###

- The majority of my prior work experience in a variety of sectors involved working in teams, as a result I have learned to work alongside many different types of people and appreciate building good team rapport. When there is harmony in a team it has a positive impact on performance and makes working more enjoyable in general.
